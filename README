NAME
    DBIx::Lite::Model - Centralise DBIx::Lite models in YAML

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a subclass of DBIx::Lite. It allows you to centralise
    your model configuration in yaml files for easy reusability.

SYNOPSIS
    Create a yaml file. You may wish to have one model have the connection
    information, then you can create other models within that yaml file
    which use that model for their connection. An example is below.

        # mydb.yml
        MyDB:
            connect: Pg:dbname=some_db
            user: foo_user
            pass: foo_pass
    
        Client:
            model: MyDB
            table: clients
            primary_key: id
    
        Customer:
            model: EcmDB
            table: customers
            primary_key: id
            related: clients <-> customers(client_id)

    This allows us to do stuff like

        # test.pl
        use DBIx::Lite::Model;
    
        my $dbix = DBIx::Lite::Model->new;  # Creates a new instance
        $dbix->config('mydb.yml');          # load the configuration

        my $customer_rs = $dbix->model('Customer'); # Returns the Customer ResultSet
        my $client_rs   = $dbix->model('Client');   # Returns the Client ResultSet

        # we want to find out what customers client with id 5 has
        my $customers = $client_rs->find(5)->customers;
        $customers->single->name; # returns the name of the clients first customer
